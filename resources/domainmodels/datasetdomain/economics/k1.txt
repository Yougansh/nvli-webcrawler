Software products and services provider Persistent Systems has invested an undisclosed amount in Los Angeles-based Hyginex Inc, which owns a patented wearable hand-hygiene improvement technology, through its venture capital fund.
The wristband-based technology developed by Hyginex is targeted at hospitals, helping them minimise hospital-acquired infections. The system uses sensors in health-care facilities to help doctors and nurses improve hand-hygiene practices.
Hyginex will use the funding raised to expand operations in the US, where every year 1.7 million infections associated with health care result in close to 100,000 patient deaths.
Persistent has invested through Persistent Venture Fund, headed by Sridhar Jagannathan. The fund had earlier invested in US-based start-up ustyme, which is a free video-call application for iPad, and health-care technology company DxNow.
