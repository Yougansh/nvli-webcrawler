To control domestic prices of pulses MMTC is planning to import 5,000 tonnes of pulses.From last two years due to drought, the gap between demand and supply of pulses has increased. The pulse demand is for 23.6 million tonnes and we produce around 17 million tonnes.

India is the Worldâ€™s largest producer of pulses, but because of day-by-day increase in domestic demand. Government fulfills this shortfall through import. In 2015-16, the country had import around 5.5 MT of pulses. However, there is still a shortfall of around 1 MT, which putting upward pressure on price.

The government import pulses through MMTC, using Price Stabilization Fund for creating buffer stock of pulses and other essential commodities so as to intervene in the market to check prices when need arises. MMTC has invited bids for import of Desi Chick Peas from Canada or Australia through tender.
