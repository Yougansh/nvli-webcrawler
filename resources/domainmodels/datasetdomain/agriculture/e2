The Spices Board is all ready to set up a Spice Museum at Willingdon Island, Kochi, Kerala, to attract and educate tourists and seafarers about the history and growth of Indian spice industry, which always had a prominent status in the history of India.

The museum will allow the tourist to collect information about the entire gamut of spice industry, beginning with cultivation to the finished product, its history, usage, storage and quality assessment. Over 30 raw spices and culinary herbs will also be shown at the museum.
