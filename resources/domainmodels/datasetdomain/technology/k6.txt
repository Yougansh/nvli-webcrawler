The joy of cycling, which is a new fad among neo-rich and health-conscious people alike, can not glow better than this!

As the cyclists struggle hard to make the SUV or bike drivers notice them by strapping reflective strips on their gear, here comes a bike that gets illuminated in toto when on the road at night.

Called the 'Lumen', the latest bike from San Francisco-based Mission Bicycle Company has its frame, fork and rims sprayed with a retro-reflective coating.

Hundreds of thousands of tiny transparent spheres are embedded in a top-layer of powder coat.

When illuminated by a car's headlights, each microscopic sphere reflects light back at the source.

The closer the car gets, the greater the intensity of the reflection.

The 'Lumen' comes in different configurations - both single-speed and internally geared, said a report in wired.com.
