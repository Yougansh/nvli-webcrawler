Researchers have suggested that genetic mutations that build up in older men's genes could affect the appearance of children with older fathers.

Researchers showed images of 4,018 men and 4,416 women aged 18-20 to groups of six men and six women, Daily Express reported.

The group found that those with older fathers were rated less attractive.

A mother passes about 15 mutations regardless of age but in men, sperm-producing cells lose ability to copy their DNA exactly, so errors occur which are then passed on.

Dr Martin Fieder, from Vienna University, who carried out the research, said that every 16 years the mutation rate doubles, adding that they found 25 mutations per sperm in a 20-year-old but at age 40 this was 65 mutations.
