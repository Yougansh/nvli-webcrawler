A thought-provoking British artist has said children visiting art galleries is "a total waste of time". Jake Chapman made his controversial comments in an interview with a newspaper. He also said other things that might anger parents, child development experts, and children. He said parents were "arrogant" for thinking children could understand modern art. He said showing a child a painting by an abstract artist was an "insult" to the artist. Mr Chapman explained that it was like telling the artist their art is "as moronic as a child". He also said: "Children are not human yet."
