Police department of Jammu and Kashmir organised a week-long youth promotional coaching camp in a bid to encourage sporting activities among talented youth residing in far-flung areas of the state.

The youth camp was inaugurated by Special Director General of Jammu and Kashmir Police (Special DGP), K. Rajendra Kumar at Gulshan ground in Jammu.

The camp is a part of Jammu and Kashmir Police`s civic action programme and more than 400 boys are participating in it.

The main aim of the camp is to enhance mental and physical ability of the youth, honing their skills in different capacities.

"The best players are in our teams and best coaches are also in our own department. So it is our responsibility to encourage sports in our state. So this is the beginning and we wish to groom new and talented boys, who reside in far flung areas of Kashmir and are deprived of such opportunities," said Additional Director General of Police and organising secretary of the youth camp, S.M. Sahai.

Sahai further informed that the event has been organised for boys in 14 to 19 years age group, who are chosen from various educational institutions of downtrodden areas.

Training in various games like volleyball, football, basketball, handball and kabaddi will be given by experienced coaches.

"These days football has become very modern and our concept is children from far flung areas will come to us, they have good strength, we will teach them new techniques of football. And also this time India is hosting Under-17 Football World Cup and if god wishes, I think these children who have come from the far flung areas, have the potential that they can represent Indian team," said football coach, Inthqaab.
