Hopes of finding any more survivors from a massive mudslide that killed at least eight people are waning after rescue crews worked through the night and pulled more bodies from the debris.
The one-square-mile slide, which happened without warning on Sunday and buried a section of the State Route 530 and the Stillaguamish River under a field of sodden earth, rocks and mangled trees up to 18 metres deep.
The slide critically injured several people - including an infant - and destroyed about 30 homes.
"I'm disappointed to tell you that after searching a very large area on foot, we didn't find anybody alive, there were no signs of life," said Travis Hots, the Fire Chief of Snohomish County Fire District 21.
Crews were able to get to the soupy, tree-strewn area after geologists flew over in a helicopter and determined it was safe enough for emergency responders and technical rescue personnel to search for survivors, authorities said.
