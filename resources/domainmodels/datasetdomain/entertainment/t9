Bollywood actor Imran Khan says he enjoyed lending his voice to the animated character Blu for the Hollywood film 'Rio 2' and he also learned about the elements that go behind the making of an animation film.

'Rio 2' is the sequel to 2011 hit animation flick 'Rio'.

"'Rio' was an absolutely fun and fantastic watch when it released a couple of years ago. The macaw Blu is a complete delight onscreen and when I was approached to voice Blu in 'Rio 2' I readily agreed to be part of the film," Imran said in a statement.

actor Imran Khan says he enjoyed lending his voice to the animated character Blu for the Hollywood film 'Rio 2'.

"Though I have always admired animations from a viewer's point of view, this time with 'Rio 2', I learnt about many fascinating elements that combine to make the final stellar film," added Imran.

Dubbing for the film was an absolutely different experience for the actor, who has featured in Hindi movies like 'Delhi Belly' and 'I Hate Luv Storys'.

"There are so many nuances that synergize beautifully and it's a completely different world when we compare to other movies. I had so much fun while dubbing as I had the complete freedom of giving various reactions and expressions through my voice, which is quite different from Bollywood, where we merely re-enact our dialogues shot previously," he said.

The 31-year-old also got a chance to sing a few lines of Blu in the movie for a party sequence and he said it "was an awesome moment too".

'Dabangg' star Sonakshi Sinha has also given voiceover in the film.

The English version of the movie has voiceover by Anne Hathaway and Jesse Eisenberg.

'Rio 2', an adventure comedy set in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, is releasing in 3D here in English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu April 11.
