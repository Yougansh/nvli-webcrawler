One of the latest heartthrobs of Bollywood Varun Dhawan is all set for his upcoming release Main Tera Hero, and has gone all out to woo the audiences.

Main Tera Hero is an out and out masala entertainer and will see Varun Dhawan, Ileana D’cruz and Nargis Fakhri tickling your funny bones. From being comic to being sexy, our actors have got it all right.

It is believed that Varun will be spoofing Ranbir in the film. The spoof is a parody that Varun Dhawan sings. It is a bhajan to the tune of Ranbir’s biggest hit ‘badtameez dil’ track. The ‘Bholenath’ parody is Varun’s way to communicate with God. Varun Dhawan himself choreographed this parody, and made the actors dance to his tunes.

Directed by David Dhawan and Produced by Balaji Motion Pictures, Main Tera Hero stars Varun Dhawan, Ileana Dcruz and Nargis Fakhri in lead roles and is all set to release on April 4, 2014.
