Yesteryear actor Rishi Kapoor, these days better known as Bollywood's heartthrob Ranbir Kapoor's father, pledged to donate his organs at the PGI on Sunday. This comes three years after a India's first Olympic gold medalist Abhinav Bindra pledged to donate his organs, and signed up for the cause in the PGI.

The actor during his first visit to the institute pledged his organs at the transplant games held at the PGI. While distributing prizes among the participants, the elder actor said, "We need to be generous and donate organs to save lives."

The actor had given his consent as soon as he came to know about the social cause. "We had Milkha Singh as well on the list. But when we got to know that Rishi Kapoor was in the city for a shooting, we requested and he immediately agreed for the cause," said Dr Ashish Sharma, from department of renal transplant surgery.

The event was significant for PGI as it has restarted the transplant games which first began at the institute in 1981, and could not be hosted after that at PGI. "These games include donors and recipients who play to symbolize that after transplant one can lead a successful and normal life," said Dr M Minz, head of the renal transplant surgery.

There have been 300 participants from far off places like Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Manipur, Jharkhand and Odisha. The sports and contests included cricket, walking, 100 metres dash, badminton, carom, tug of war and 400m relay race. Over 50 medals in 12 categories were distributed at the end of the games by Kapoor.

Witnessing the success of the event and on popular demand Dr Sharma announced that the department of transplant surgery would host this event every year.
