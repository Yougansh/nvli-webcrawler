Imarti Devi to take on turn-coat Bhagirath
BHOPAL: Congress on Wednesday evening announced the name of two-term MLA from Dabra assembly seat, Imarti Devi, as the Lok Sabha candidate from Bhind to take on turn-coat Bhagirath Prasad. With this announcement Bhind ceases to be an interesting fight.
On March 8, the Congress declared its first list of 22 candidates from Madhya Pradesh, including Prasad. A loyalist of AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh faction, Prasad was fielded from the SC reserved Bhind seat.
However, by next morning the Congress was aghast to find that their candidate had changed affiliation. Prasad claimed he joined the BJP a day after the Congress announced his candidature because "situation within the Congress party was no longer the same".
BJP fielded Prasad as their party candidate from Bhind while the Congress was still groping in the dark about who to field against the turn-coat. The decision was finally taken on Wednesday.
Essentially a bureaucrat, Prasad was never a leader and though he contested the 2009 Lok Sabha polls, he was defeated by BJP's Ashok Argal. However, the support of the ruling party might work to his advantage this time.
On the contrary, Imarti Devi has won Dabra assembly seat in her own right for two terms. She is a sitting MLA and despite the rural background, her performance in the state assembly has been admirable. But whether she can win Bhind in the face of a Narendra Modi wave is to be seen.
