BJP played with Hindu sentiment by deifying Modi, says Digvijay
The BJP prime ministerial candidate is in a habit of ill- treating the seniors after endearing them
BHOPAL: AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh said the BJP dishonoured Hindus in the country by raising the slogans like ‘ Har Har Modi, Ghar Ghar Modi’, chanted in Varanasi.
Talking with media persons during his visit to the state capital on Sunday, the Congress leader said he is happy that Shankararcharya Swarupanand Maharaj intervened into the matter and talked with RSS chief and it led to the decision from the BJP that it won’t rake up the slogan during the election.
Raising a question Singh said why the BJP did not stop its workers from chanting the slogan in one and half month and only acted after the seer intervened? Digvijaya said, it was actually planned by the PR company, engaged in building Modi’s image like the God.
He said it is a working style of BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi that he first targets the leaders who are close to him and after LK Advani, now it is Rajnath Singh on his target.
He reiterated his statement that he would contest election against Modi from Varanasi even if he is pitted by the party against him. Singh said he is saddened with the BJP’s decision not to field Jaswant Singh in Rajasthan.On Kailash Joshi’s statement, he said the BJP leader would have made such statement under influence of Bhang.
