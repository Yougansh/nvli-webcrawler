CM dharna: Code, govt rules violated: Commissioner
BHOPAL: The state government not only violated the Model Code of Conduct ( MCC) during the BJP- sponsored dharna and state- wide bandh in protest against the Central government’s apathy, but also violated the government norm of accepting any amount above Rs 20,000 only by cheque.
Divisional Commissioner SB Singh’s reply to the election commission on four specific points revealed it. The commissioner’s report endorsed the district returning officer’s report that found violation of MCC during the BJP’s dharna where chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and his ministers staged protest against the UPA government for delay in compensation to hail- hit farmers, said sources in the ECI.
The CEO office has sent the replies of the general administration department, divisional commissioner, Bhopal returning officer and chief minister’s office to the ECI. The state ruling BJP claimed to have collected Rs 7.41 crore at the dharna for compensation to farmers under CM relief corpus. The Commission had asked from the authorities whether the fund was deposited in relevant account.
The replies said, the fund was deposited in CM relief corpus and it was over Rs 20,000 in several cases collected in cash on the stage, from different persons. As per the central government norms, the government cannot collect over Rs 20,000 from one person in cash. It will be taken only by cheque. ” This is one more irregularity discovered during the probe being carried out on the instructions of the ECI,”
Government officials said fund was collected without permission. The returning officers and other authorities found no fact in another allegation that state government’s ministers reached at the dharna site by official vehicle carrying red beacon lights. The commission is yet to take final decision on the MCC violation by the government’s ministers.
