Pratap faces revolt in Hoshangabad
BHOPAL: Congress turncoat Rao Uday Pratap Singh is facing opposition from local BJP leaders in Hoshangabad from where he was reportedly promised a BJP ticket before he joined the saffron party in November last, barely a month before assembly elections. Singh was sitting MP and his switching loyalty to BJP turned out to be a major embarrassment for Congress.
Uday Pratap Singh is said to be a supporter of senior Congress leader and Union minister Kamal Nath. With BJP leaders holding parleys for distributing tickets, a large number of posters have surfaced in Uday Pratap's constituency, casting aspersions on his integrity. The posters read, "Uday ne Congress mein malai, khai, ab bhajpa mein nazar gadai." (Uday enjoyed power in Congress and now he is eyeing the BJP for it) Terming it a handiwork of "frustrated Congress leaders of the region," Uday said adding that BJP is a party of people with ethics
Like Uday, another turncoat, Bhagirath Prasad, is also waxing eloquent on BJP. BJP sources, however, said tha Uday Pratap has never been comfortable in the new party. "We can never expect him to be our leader. We have our own hierarchy and cadre", said a senior leader of the BJP district unit. Uday, however, claimed, "I have not joined the BJP for power."
"Bhajpa naitik mulyon ki party hai. Congress aur BJP mein jameen asmaan ka fark hai. I am loving it (BJP is a party which believes in moral values and there is a lot of difference between Congress and BJP)," he said claiming that he the local unit of the party has extended full support to him.
Uday said he had never bargained for a BJP ticket. "Is it a grocery shop that you go and ask for a ticket?" he asked.
