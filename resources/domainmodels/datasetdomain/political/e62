Sushma Swaraj a better PM candidate than Modi: Digvijaya Singh

Bhopal:Senior BJP leader Sushma Swaraj who has of late been expressing her opposition to some decisions of the party regarding ticket distribution has found a supporter in Congress General Secretary Digvijaya Singh.
The former Madhya Pradesh chief minister said on Monday that Sushma is a better choice for the PM than the BJP's official nominee Narendra Modi. He said "Sushma is acceptable like Atal Bihari Vajpayee. It's now no BJP only Modi."
Digvijaya's remarks holds significance as it comes after the recent war of words between Sushma and her colleague Arun Jaitley on ticket distribution. When party veteran Jaswant Singh was denied a ticket of his choice Swaraj had openly said that the decision on Barmer ticket was not taken in the BJP's Central Election Committee.
Commenting on Rahul Gandhi not being projected by the Congress as its prime ministerial candidate, Digvijaya said it's a question of timing in politics.
Reacting to the 'Har Har Modi' chant by BJP and Modi now asking tem not to do the same, Singh said that the BJP leader had realised it very late. It was only after a Shankaracharya spoke to the RSS chief to ask the BJP workers to refrain from chanting 'Har Har Modi' that the Gujarat Chief Minister restrained his supporters from doing so.
Digvijaya, who had recently volunteered to challenge Modi in Varanasi, reiterated his stand on contesting from the crucial seat in the Lok Sabha elections.
