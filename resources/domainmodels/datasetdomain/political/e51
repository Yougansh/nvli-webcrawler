Digvijaya questions seat displacement of senior BJP leaders
BHOPAL: Congress general secretary Digvijaya Singh has questioned as to why BJP was "displacing" its senior leaders from their constituencies if there was a "Modi wave" in the country. 
"If there is a Modi wave, why displace seat winning seniors like Dr Murli Manohar Joshi, Navjot Singh Sidhu and Lalji Tandon?" Singh asked on Sunday. 
Singh also questioned the denial of Lok Sabha election ticket to BJP veteran Jaswant Singh from Barmer. 
"Why persecute Jaswant ji?" the Congress leader asked. 
Angry over denial of ticket to him in the Lok Sabha elections, Jaswant Singh, 76, attacked the BJP leadership, saying there was need to differentiate between "real" and "fake" BJP as whatever was happening in the party now was not in line with its ideology. 
Later, senior BJP leader Sushma Swaraj opposed the denial of ticket to Jaswant Singh saying that the Barmer decision was "not taken" by the party's central election committee and that she was "pained" at the step.
