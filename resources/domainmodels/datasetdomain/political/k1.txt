BJPon Monday approached the Election Commission seeking action against Union Minister and NCP chief Sharad Pawar under the Representation of People’s Act (RPA), after he asked his party workers to take advantage of the multi-phase polling in the state by “voting twice”.

Pawar had later sought to temper his remarks saying they were made in a “lighter vein”.

BJP leader Kirit Somaiya today submitted a letter to State Chief Electoral Officer, seeking action against Pawar under the Act, and demanded that Pawar be removed from the Union ministry. NCP should be banned, he added.

Somaiya also met senior IPS officer Deven Bharti (Special Inspector General of Police, DGP Office), seeking action against Pawar.

Making light of Somaiya’s demands, the NCP said it was a “publicity gimmick.”

“Somaiya has this habit of staying in the news by any means. He has this penchant for gimmicks and this is his latest attempt,” state NCP president Bhaskar Jadhav said.

Pawar, during the conclave of ‘mathadi’ (head loaders) workers in adjoining Navi Mumbai yesterday, had asked NCP activists to take advantage of the multi-phase polling in the state by voting twice, first at their hometowns and then at places of work.

“Last time (in 2009), the polling in Satara and Mumbai was on the same day and people went to their hometowns. But this time, polling in Satara is on April 17 and here on April 24.

“Vote for the ‘clock’ (NCP symbol) there (in Satara) and come back to vote for the ‘clock’ here as well,” Pawar had said.

However, he had later told reporters that his statement was made in “a lighter vein and had a tinge of satire to it.”
