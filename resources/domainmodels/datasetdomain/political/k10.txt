Southern star Nagarjuna is set to meet BJP PM nominee Narendra Modi in Ahmedabad at 4 pm on Monday.
He will meet Modi at his residence amid speculation that he might join the BJP.

He is the second film star from the south to meet the BJP's prime ministerial candidate after Pawan Kalyan, the brother of Union minister Chiranjeevi.

The star is also likely to seek Lok Sabha ticket for his wife Amla. For last few days, political and film circles were abuzz with speculations that the actress-turned-activist is keen to contest Lok Sabha elections from Vijayawada.

The actor held talks with senior BJP leader M. Venkaiah Naidu during last few days. It was immediately not clear if Nagarjuna would also take a plunge into electoral politics.

Son of thespian Akkineni Nageswara Rao, who died recently, Nagarjuna is one of the top actors of Tollywood. Nageswara Rao was never interested in politics but the family maintained good relations with TDP and Congress when they were in power.

Nagarjuna is meeting Modi two days after Pawan Kalyan met the Gujarat chief minister in Ahmedabad to extend his support.
