Drama in Bhopal over Advani posters
BHOPAL: Hours before the BJP central election committee began its meeting on Wednesday to determine party patriarch L K Advani's Lok Sabha seat, there was high-voltage drama in the Madhya Pradesh capital. BJP workers put up huge banners on at least a dozen thoroughfares at the crack of dawn, inviting Advani to the constituency. However, by afternoon, the posters were torn down. 
Speaking to reporters, Alok Sharma, BJP Bhopal chief said, "It's all over the media that Advani may contest from Bhopal. Enthusiastic workers picked the cue and displayed the bill-boards." 
The enthusiasm did not last long as by 2pm, Sangh parivar bigwigs ordered the welcome posters to be torn down. The hoardings and banners vanished in a jiffy. 
While the big saffron drama was unfolding in Delhi, two state leaders were engaged in a debate over BJP's candidature for the Bhopal Lok Sabha seat. Former CM and now minister for home affairs Babulal Gaur said he was assured by the party's central leadership that his daughter-in-law and mayor of Bhopal Krishna Gaur would be fielded. "It has been said Krishna is the most eligible," Gaur said. 
But former CM and two-term MP from Bhopal Kailash Joshi said, "When I decided not to contest from Bhopal 10 days ago, I wanted Advani to contest. His coming to Bhopal will benefit the people of the state. I have been assured that Advani's name will be announced for Bhopal."
