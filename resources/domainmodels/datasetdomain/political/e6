Opinion poll gives BJP 146, Cong 40 in 12 states
An opinion poll conducted by Hansa Research Group, which was aired on NDTV on Thursday, predicted a BJP victory in 146 of the 319 Lok Sabha constituencies covered by the survey. The Congress would end up with just 40 seats, and “others” with at least 85. According to the opinion poll, the BJP-led NDA would win 166 of the 319 seats, while the Congress-led UPA would get 52 seats.
The survey predicted that the BJP would not only substantially recover the ground it lost in the 2012 Assembly elections in Karnataka, but would also win 20 Lok Sabha seats from the state in the Lok Sabha polls, one more than its 2009 tally. The Congress would win just six of the 28 seats in the state, while the JD-S would bag two, one less than its tally in the last parliamentary elections.
The opinion poll, which was aired a day before the Election Commission notifies the first phase of the elections, covered Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.
It gave the BJP 23 seats in Gujarat, nine in Chhattisgarh, 24 in Madhya Pradesh, 33 in Maharashtra, seven in Haryana, two in Delhi and 19 in Rajasthan. The Congress was likely to win three in Gujarat, two in Chhattisgarh, four in Madhya Pradesh, 12 in Maharashtra, three in Haryana, one in Delhi and five in Rajasthan.
