KC JOSHI DRAWS FLAK FROM CONG
Madhya Pradesh's former Chief Minister Kailash Chandra Joshi, who is the Bharatiya Janata Party's outgoing parliamentarian representing Bhopal, drew heavy flak on Thursday from the rival camp as the Congress alleged that he demanded Rs one crore from a person desirous of contesting from the constituency.
While talking to media persons in the press conference convened in haste, Congress Secretary Rakesh Kalia said, “This incident exposed the BJP, which claims to be a party with a difference. The saffron party is selling tickets all over India. Hence there is a delay in announcement of nominees. The BJP is axing democracy and the Congress is committed to unmasking the saffron party.”
A journalist, who visited Joshi's local residence on Thursday, happened to observe the leader conversing over phone regarding the 'deal' and captured the goings-on. A compact disc of the incident was played before the press. “The high command has been apprised of the matter,” Congress state Vice-President Manak Agrawal said.
However, the Congress leaders did not provide any CD to the media persons. Congress Spokesman Ravi Saxena told that it was not the job of Congress to provide CD to media. He claimed that a clipping regarding the exposure is available on social media, but factually, in the 29 seconds’ clipping, there is nothing objectionable.
“Had I accepted money, I would have possessed crores today. I have never demanded money during my political career spanning 40 years,” Joshi told media persons after Congress made serious allegations.
