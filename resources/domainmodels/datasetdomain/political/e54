Ready to take on Modi, Digvijaya says
BHOPAL: AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh said he is ready to contest from Varanasi if his party asks him to do so. Singh arrived here at Bhopal by the evening flight and was talking to a group of reporters at his residence. For the first time he admitted it publicly that he was willing to contest against Modi if his party asks him to do so.
Referring to 'har har Modi' controversy, Singh said that the party took long to decide hurting the sentiments of the people. Talking about Modi 's dominance, he said that the Gujarat chief minister is known for victimizing politically his opponents and Lal Krishna Advani was also a victim of the same.
