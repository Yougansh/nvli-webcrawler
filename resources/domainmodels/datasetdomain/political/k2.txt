The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will make gains in Kerala, party national executive member Prashant Bhushan has said.

He was addressing an AAP ‘Jana Sabha’ meeting at Kozhukully, near here, on Sunday.

“Mainstream political parties are formulating policies for the benefit of corporates. They do not care for the welfare of people. The AAP represents a change in politics. Fearing the change, other parties, corporates and a section of the media are attacking the AAP,” he said.

He stated that many areas of Gujarat were economically backward despite the government's claim of widespread development. “Many areas have no power connection. Some areas get power for only four hours a day,” he added.

He said the people of the country had realised the importance of the battles waged by the AAP against corruption, communalism and violence.

“If these ideas resonate with the people of Thrissur, Sara Joseph, the AAP candidate in the constituency, will gain,” he added.
