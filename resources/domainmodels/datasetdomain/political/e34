Congress accuses BJP's Kailash Joshi of selling Bhopal seat
Bhopal: In what could add to tensions for the Bharatiya Janata Party already facing flak over ticket distribution, Congress on Thursday evening came up with a CD in which sitting Bhopal MP and BJP veteran Kailash Joshi is seen asking for money to win candidature for a seat. 

In the CD, which Congress called a part of its sting, Joshi is seen sitting at his home along with BJP leaders Shailendra Pradhan, Jeetendra Daga and Vishnu Khatri, and with some media personnel whose camera were on. Responding to media personnel's query over delay in finalising candidate for the Bhopal parliamentary seat, Joshi said the seat was quite expensive. 
Joshi is then seen receiving a call and informing the person on the other side that the decision on the candidature for the Bhopal seat would be taken by evening. He is then heard saying: “Get Rs 1 crore, we will make you contest from the seat.” 
Hours after Congress showed the CD at a press conference and accused Joshi of selling Lok Sabha seat, the BJP veteran said that his conversation was being misconstrued. The sitting Bhopal MP said that he was just saying that it was expensive to fight polls these days.
Joshi has been representing the Bhopal constituency in the Lok Sabha since 2004. 
He had recently offered BJP patriarch LK Advani to contest from Bhopal seat.
