ave fails to dampen P C Sharma's spirits
BHOPAL: Last time when P C Sharma won an election (state assembly election 1998), he had mobile vans set up selling onions at throwaway prices. After 15 years, Sharma is a candidate again, targeting a feat no Congressman has achieved in three decades â€” winning a Lok Sabha poll in BJP bastion of Bhopal.
Sharma believes he has a legitimate claim to the Bhopal seat. "I have been working here for three decades and have done more for the city than any BJP MP, be it SC Verma, Uma Bharti or Kailash Joshi," he said.
Bumper sticker on his SUV says it all, 'Din ho yaa raat, PC Sharma aap ke saath'. Nearly two dozen locations were covered on Sunday. "There's no wave. If you get to know about a trend, do let me know," he said.
"I was prepared to take on the upper crest of BJP," he said, reflecting on BJP's nomination of little known candidate Alok Sanjar against Sharma. In Karond, Sharma addressed function of Brahmin Samaj on Sunday. The engineer turned politician was polite and tried to excite the Brahmin base and said, "Joh aap samahj rehay hain, koi aur nahi samajh raha." The biggest challenge, perhaps for the district Congress president, is garnering support of local Congressmen. The party's MLA in Bhopal Arif Aqueel, declared his desire that the party should give ticket to a minority candidate.
For now, Sharma is manoeuvring his play. Yet he is in search for 'onions' that could spoil BJP's curry.
