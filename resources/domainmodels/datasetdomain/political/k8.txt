Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar on Monday  said voting for BJP during the upcoming general elections would mean strengthening the hands of the party-led state government.

“Two MPs from Goa won’t make much difference in forming the government at the Centre. But, for the state surely it would make a huge difference,” Parrikar told reporters after BJP’s North Goa candidate Sripad Naik filed nomination here.

“Goa should vote for BJP candidates to strengthen and help the state government,” he said in presence of Naik.

He expressed confidence that Naik, who was a minister in the earlier Atal Bihari Vajpayee cabinet, will also be part of Narendra Modi cabinet once the NDA-led union government is formed.

“It is natural that Naik would be inducted in the Union Cabinet,” he stated.

On the occasion, Naik said the international airport at Mopa and financial package for people affected with ban on the mining activity would be major highlights of the party’s election manifesto.

The party would also pursue (with the Centre) the issue of special status for Goa and immediate restarting of the legal mining activity in the state, he added.
