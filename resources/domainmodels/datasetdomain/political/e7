MPCC chief courts trouble for ‘rewarding’ drummer
INDORE: Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee chief and Khandwa MP Arun Yadav seems to be in trouble for "rewarding" a young tribal drummer with cash at Bhagoria festival in Jhirniya area of Khargone district. 
Khargone district election officer Navneet Mohan Kothari on Thursday sought a detailed report from the SDM, which would be sent to the Election Commission. "We've sought a detailed report from the SDM after learning about the incident from our sources and local media," Kothari said. 
The MPCC chief, who met hailstorm-hit farmers of his parliamentary constituency in Khandwa and Khargone districts, took time off to attend Bhagoria, a tribal festival, on Wednesday. Just when he was about to board a chopper, a young tribal drummer, Kishan Rathore, approached him for "reward". The Khandwa MP took out Rs 200 ash and gave it to him, which was caught on camera. 
Congress spokesperson N S Saluja said the incident didn't violate model code of conduct. "Giving cash to the drummer didn't amount to bribing someone to vote. It is part of tradition," he said. 
During recent assembly polls, Saluja alleged violation of model code of conduct by then state industries minister and BJP candidate Kailash Vijayvargiya.
