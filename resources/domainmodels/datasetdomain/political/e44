BJP's LS target in MP: Glitch in ‘Mission 29’?
BHOPAL: When the BJP romped back to power for a third term in Madhya Pradesh three months ago, the RSS gave the party a 100% success target for 2014. The BJP declared it would focus on winning all 29 Lok Sabha seats. But last week, when the party announced its list of 24 candidates for MP, 'Mission 29' seemed to have hit an unexpected roadblock.
On the face of it, the BJP juggernaut should be unstoppable in MP. In a state where the December 2013 assembly polls saw Shivraj Singh Chouhan convincingly win a third term as chief minister, the appeal of PM-candidate Narendra Modi acts as a force multiplier.
But despite loud noises from 12, Ashoka Road — BJP's headquarters — about a "fight for every seat", the party list seems to have virtually given a walkover to Congress in seats such as Rajgarh and Sidhi, both traditional turfs of Congress stalwarts. While Rajgarh is the old bastion of AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh, the late Arjun Singh's son Ajay wields clout in Sidhi. The BJP candidate in Rajgarh is little-known Rodmal Nagar.
