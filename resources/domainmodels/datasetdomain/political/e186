Ex-BJP MP writes to Rajnath over poll ticket distribution
BHOPAL: Former BJP MP Phool Chand Verma has questioned the way tickets were being distributed by the party in Madhya Pradesh for the ensuing Lok Sabha elections. 
"I would like to know the basis on which tickets for the Lok Sabha polls were being distributed by the party," he asked in a letter sent yesterday to BJP President Rajnath Singh. 
He said committed party workers were being harassed and sidelined by certain sections in BJP and attempts being made to end their political career. 
The five-time MP from Shajapur-Dewas questioned the distribution of party tickets to certain candidates in Madhya Pradesh at the expense of deserving ones. 
The former MP said he cannot understand the message that is being sent out when Madhya Pradesh BJP president Narendra Singh Tomar is unable to contest from Morena, from where he won in 2009. 
Verma was miffed the way some party leaders have been made Ministers in the State's BJP Government.
