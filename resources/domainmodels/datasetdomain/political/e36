Sibling rivalry in Dhar
INDORE: Political battle in Dhar Lok Sabha has turned into a sibling rivalry. Daughter of former deputy chief minister late Jamuna Devi, Dr Hemlala Dhand and her nephew Umang Singar are in the fray from Dhar representing Aaam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Congress party.
Singar is a sitting Congress MLA from Gandhwani assembly seat and had lost 2004 Lok Sabha elections, while doctor-turned-politician Hemlata Dhand is contesting for the first time. Hemlata worked as a gynecologist at MY Hospital, Indore and is seeking support of voters on basis of her mother's contribution to growth and development of tribal population.
Singar, ruling out withdrawal from poll fray in favour of his cousin, told TOI, "Party has shown confidence in me and has selected me to contest elections. I will follow directives of high command and will win."
Sources said, after death of Jamuna Devi in 2010, family feud between Singar and Hemlata came out in open. They had come face to face to settle property dispute, which hogged headlines. While Hemlata was a full-time doctor, Singar supported his aunt in tribal areas including Kukshi, Gandhwani and Manawar assembly seats. He was representative of Jamuna Devi in tribal areas and became a local leader. Sources said Singar got benefit of infightings within Congress as Dhar district president Bal Mukund Gautam was opposed to candidature of Gajendra Singh Rajukhedi and wanted to rope in former MLA Pratap Grewal or Radheshyam Muwal from the seat.
The other strong candidature from Dhar seat is BJP candidate Savita Thakur. She is currently director of Dharampur Mandi and shot into limelight with her hard work in the area. She owned a STD booth in initial years before joining politics.
